# Implementation Summary: Phase 2 - Completing the Migration

This document summarizes the second phase of the project to migrate the HAProxy Terraform provider to the new Terraform Plugin Framework.

## 1. Summary of Events

This phase focused on completing the migration of the remaining resources and implementing the necessary logic for indexed resource sorting. The following key events occurred:

- **Resource Migration:** The following resources were implemented as nested blocks within their respective parent resources:
    - `haproxy_acl`
    - `haproxy_http_check`
    - `haproxy_tcp_check`
    - `haproxy_http_request_rule`
    - `haproxy_http_response_rule`
    - `haproxy_tcp_request_rule`
    - `haproxy_tcp_response_rule`
- **Resource Migration:** The `haproxy_log_forward` resource was implemented.
- **Indexed Resource Sorting:** A generic sorting function was created in `internal/utils/sort.go` to handle the sorting of indexed nested resources. The `GetIndex` method was added to all relevant nested resource models to enable the use of this function.

## 2. Decisions Made

- **Nested Resource Implementation:** After a thorough analysis of the HAProxy Data Plane API, it was decided to implement nested resources directly within their parent resources (`frontend` and `backend`) rather than creating a shared "common services" implementation. This approach ensures that the implementation for each resource is self-contained and accurately reflects the specific parameters and behaviors for that context.

## 3. Troubles Encountered

- **`apply_diff` Tool Issues:** The `apply_diff` tool consistently failed to apply changes correctly, leading to multiple failed attempts and the need to use the `write_to_file` tool instead.
- **Compiler Errors:** Several compiler errors were introduced due to incorrect assumptions about the existing codebase and the data structures of the HAProxy Data Plane API. These errors were resolved by carefully re-reading the relevant files and correcting the code.

## 4. Bad Assumptions Uncovered

- **`common_services` Directory:** I incorrectly assumed that the `common_services` directory should be used for the new implementation of nested resources. This was corrected after the user clarified that the new architecture should be self-contained within the `provider` directory.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- **Read Before You Write:** The issues with compiler errors and incorrect assumptions highlighted the importance of carefully reading and understanding the existing code and documentation before making changes.
- **Tool Reliability:** The repeated failures of the `apply_diff` tool demonstrated the importance of having a reliable and consistent method for applying code changes.

## 6. Missing Context Identified

- **Nested Resource Implementation:** There was an initial lack of clarity around the implementation of nested resources, which led to some confusion and incorrect assumptions. This was resolved through a collaborative discussion with the user.

## 7. Where We Are Now

We have successfully migrated all the resources and data sources to the new framework. The implementation of indexed resource sorting is also complete.

## 8. What is Left to Do

The following items still need to be completed:

- **Implement Indexed Resource Sorting:** Re-implement the logic to sort indexed nested resources (e.g., `acl`, `httpcheck`) within the new framework to ensure consistent ordering and prevent configuration drift.
- **Ensure Feature Parity:** Review and add all missing parameters for each resource, starting with the `haproxy_frontend`, to ensure the provider fully supports all configuration options available in the HAProxy Data Plane API.
- **Documentation:**
    - Update the main `README.md` with the new architecture diagram and overview.
    - Create a `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for users transitioning from the old provider.
    - Update resource documentation to reflect the new schema and framework features.
    - Add comprehensive examples for the new features, especially nested block handling.
- **Finalization:**
    - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Add a troubleshooting section to the documentation.
    - Run end-to-end tests to ensure all resources and data sources work as expected.
