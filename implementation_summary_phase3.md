# Implementation Summary: Phase 3 - Documentation and Finalization

This document summarizes the third phase of the project to migrate the HAProxy Terraform provider to the new Terraform Plugin Framework.

## 1. Summary of Events

This phase focused on completing the documentation, adding examples, and ensuring feature parity for all resources. The following key events occurred:

- **Indexed Resource Sorting:** Implemented sorting for all indexed nested resources.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensured that all resources have feature parity with the HAProxy Data Plane API.
- **Documentation:**
    - Created a `README.md` file with a basic overview of the provider.
    - Created documentation for all resources.
- **Examples:** Created an example `main.tf` file to demonstrate the usage of the provider.

## 2. Decisions Made

- **Documentation Structure:** Created a `docs/resources` directory to store the documentation for each resource.
- **Example Structure:** Created an `examples` directory to store example Terraform configurations.

## 3. Troubles Encountered

- **`apply_diff` Tool Issues:** The `apply_diff` tool consistently failed to apply changes correctly, leading to multiple failed attempts and the need to use the `write_to_file` tool instead.
- **Compiler Errors:** Several compiler errors were introduced due to incorrect assumptions about the existing codebase and the data structures of the HAProxy Data Plane API. These errors were resolved by carefully re-reading the relevant files and correcting the code.
- **Incomplete Documentation:** The initial documentation for the resources was incomplete and did not include all the nested blocks. This was corrected after the user provided feedback.

## 4. Bad Assumptions Uncovered

- **`common_services` Directory:** I incorrectly assumed that the `common_services` directory should be used for the new implementation of nested resources. This was corrected after the user clarified that the new architecture should be self-contained within the `provider` directory.
- **`README.md` Content:** I initially created a `README.md` file with minimal content. This was corrected after the user provided feedback.
- **Resource Documentation:** I initially created incomplete documentation for the resources. This was corrected after the user provided feedback.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- **Read Before You Write:** The issues with compiler errors and incorrect assumptions highlighted the importance of carefully reading and understanding the existing code and documentation before making changes.
- **Tool Reliability:** The repeated failures of the `apply_diff` tool demonstrated the importance of having a reliable and consistent method for applying code changes.
- **Comprehensive Changes:** It is more efficient to make all the necessary changes for a given file at once to avoid cascading errors and rework.

## 6. Missing Context Identified

- **HAProxy Data Plane API Documentation:** There was an initial lack of clarity around the full set of parameters for each resource. This was resolved by the user providing the relevant documentation.

## 7. Where We Are Now

The foundational migration of the provider's resources and data sources to the Terraform Plugin Framework is complete. Key functionalities like indexed resource sorting have been implemented. Initial documentation and examples have been created. However, a critical gap remains: the nested configuration blocks within resources like `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend` do not yet have full feature parity with the official HAProxy Data Plane API documentation. The existing implementation only covers a subset of the available parameters.

## 8. What is Left to Do

The immediate and highest-priority task is to achieve full feature parity for all nested resources by implementing all parameters defined in the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation (v2 and v3).

- **Implement Full Feature Parity for Nested Resources:**
    - `bind` (in `haproxy_frontend`)
    - `acl` (in `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`)
    - `http-request-rule` (in `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`)
    - `http-response-rule` (in `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`)
    - `tcp-request-rule` (in `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`)
    - `tcp-response-rule` (in `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`)
    - `httpcheck` (in `haproxy_backend`)
    - `tcp-check` (in `haproxy_backend`)
- **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`**
- **Add a troubleshooting section to the documentation**
- **Run end-to-end tests to ensure all resources and data sources work as expected**
