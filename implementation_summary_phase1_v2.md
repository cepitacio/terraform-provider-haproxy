# Implementation Summary: Phase 1 - Migration to Terraform Plugin Framework (V2)

This document summarizes the first phase of the project to migrate the HAProxy Terraform provider to the new Terraform Plugin Framework, based on the V5 documentation plan. This version provides a more accurate and comprehensive overview of the project's status.

## 1. Summary of Events

The initial goal was to migrate the existing HAProxy Terraform provider from the legacy `terraform-plugin-sdk/v2` to the modern `terraform-plugin-framework`. This involved a series of steps, starting with updating the project dependencies and scaffolding the new provider structure.

The following resources and data sources were migrated:

- **Provider:** The core provider configuration was migrated to the new framework, including authentication and API versioning.
- **Resources:**
    - `haproxy_global`
    - `haproxy_frontend` (with nested `bind`, `acl`, `monitor_fail`, `httprequestrule`, and `httpresponserule` blocks)
    - `haproxy_backend` (with nested `balance`, `httpchk_params`, `forwardfor`, and `httpcheck` blocks)
    - `haproxy_server`
    - `haproxy_resolver`
    - `haproxy_nameserver`
    - `haproxy_peers`
    - `haproxy_peer_entry`
    - `haproxy_stick_rule`
    - `haproxy_stick_table`
- **Data Sources:**
    - `haproxy_backends`
    - `haproxy_frontends`

## 2. Decisions Made

- **Framework Migration:** The decision to migrate to the Terraform Plugin Framework was based on the V5 documentation plan, which highlighted the benefits of improved nested block handling, clearer schema definitions, and enhanced error reporting.
- **API Versioning:** The provider was updated to support both `v2` and `v3` of the HAProxy Data Plane API, with `v2` as the default for backward compatibility.
- **Nested Blocks:** The `haproxy_bind` resource was integrated as a nested block within the `haproxy_frontend` resource, as requested. Similarly, other common services like `acl`, `monitor_fail`, `httprequestrule`, `httpresponserule`, and `httpcheck` were implemented as nested blocks within their respective parent resources.
- **Indexed Resource Sorting:** For nested resources that are order-dependent and require an `index` attribute (e.g., `acl`, `httprequestrule`, `httpresponserule`, `httpcheck`), the SDKv2 implementation consistently sorts these items before processing. This is crucial for preventing persistent diffs in Terraform plans and ensuring rules are applied in the correct order. This logic must be carried over to the new framework implementation.

## 3. Troubles Encountered

- **Dependency Resolution:** After updating the `go.mod` file, there were initial issues with resolving the new framework dependencies. This was resolved by running `go mod tidy`.
- **Incorrect Type Usage:** There were several instances where incorrect types were used in the code, such as `types.Type` instead of `attr.Type` and `types.ObjectAsOptions{}` instead of `basetypes.ObjectAsOptions{}`. These were identified and corrected.
- **Incorrect Method Signatures:** There was an instance where the `Update` method for a resource had an incorrect signature, which was identified and corrected.
- **Missing Client Functions:** There were instances where the resource code called client functions that had not yet been implemented. This was resolved by implementing the missing functions in the client.

## 4. Bad Assumptions Uncovered

- **Resource Completeness:** I incorrectly assumed that all resources had been migrated on a few occasions, leading to premature updates of the to-do list. This highlighted the need for more careful tracking of the migration progress.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- **Attention to Detail:** The issues with incorrect types and method signatures highlighted the importance of paying close attention to detail when writing code, especially when working with a new framework.
- **User Feedback:** The user's feedback was invaluable in identifying and correcting errors. It highlighted the importance of clear communication and a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

## 6. Missing Context Identified

- **Full Scope of Resources:** The initial to-do list was incomplete and did not include all the resources that needed to be migrated. This was identified after reviewing the `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN_V5.md` file again.

## 7. Where We Are Now

We have successfully migrated the following resources and data sources to the new framework:

- **Provider:** `haproxy`
- **Resources:** `haproxy_global`, `haproxy_frontend`, `haproxy_backend`, `haproxy_server`, `haproxy_resolver`, `haproxy_nameserver`, `haproxy_peers`, `haproxy_peer_entry`, `haproxy_stick_rule`, `haproxy_stick_table`
- **Data Sources:** `haproxy_backends`, `haproxy_frontends`

The following nested blocks have also been implemented:

- `bind`
- `acl`
- `monitor_fail`
- `httprequestrule`
- `httpresponserule`
- `balance`
- `httpchk_params`
- `forwardfor`
- `httpcheck`

## 8. What is Left to Do

The following items still need to be completed, based on the `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN_V5.md`:

- **Resource Migration:**
    - Implement `haproxy_acl` as a nested block in frontends and backends
    - Implement `haproxy_http_check` as a nested block in backends
    - Implement `haproxy_tcp_check` as a nested block in backends
    - Implement `haproxy_http_request_rule` as a nested block in frontends and backends
    - Implement `haproxy_http_response_rule` as a nested block in frontends and backends
    - Implement `haproxy_tcp_request_rule` as a nested block in frontends and backends
    - Implement `haproxy_tcp_response_rule` as a nested block in frontends and backends
    - `haproxy_log_forward`
- **Implement Indexed Resource Sorting:**
    - Re-implement the logic to sort indexed nested resources (e.g., `acl`, `httpcheck`) within the new framework to ensure consistent ordering and prevent configuration drift.
- **Ensure Feature Parity:**
    - Review and add all missing parameters for each resource, starting with the `haproxy_frontend`, to ensure the provider fully supports all configuration options available in the HAProxy Data Plane API.
- **Documentation and Examples:**
    - Update the main `README.md` with the new architecture diagram and overview.
    - Create a `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for users transitioning from the old provider.
    - Update resource documentation to reflect the new schema and framework features.
    - Add comprehensive examples for the new features, especially nested block handling.
- **Finalization:**
    - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Add a troubleshooting section to the documentation.
    - Run end-to-end tests to ensure all resources and data sources work as expected.
