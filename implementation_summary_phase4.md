This document summarizes the fourth phase of the migration of the HAProxy Terraform provider to the new Terraform Plugin Framework. This phase focused on achieving full feature parity for the remaining nested resources within the `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend` resources.

## Conversation Summary

The conversation began by continuing the work from the previous phase. The primary goal was to implement full feature parity for all nested resources within the `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend` resources.

The following is a summary of the work completed in this phase:

1.  **`http-response-rule`:** The `HttpResponseRulePayload` in `internal/provider/models.go` was updated to include all parameters from the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation. The changes were then propagated to the resource definitions for `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`.

2.  **`tcp-request-rule`:** The `TcpRequestRulePayload` in `internal/provider/models.go` was updated to include all parameters from the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation. The changes were then propagated to the resource definitions for `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`.

3.  **`tcp-response-rule`:** The `TcpResponseRulePayload` in `internal/provider/models.go` was updated to include all parameters from the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation. The changes were then propagated to the resource definitions for `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend`.

4.  **`httpcheck`:** The `HttpcheckPayload` in `internal/provider/models.go` was updated to include all parameters from the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation. The `httpcheck` nested resource was added to `internal/provider/resource_backend.go`, and the `haproxy_client.go` was updated to handle the CRUD operations for the `httpcheck` resource.

## Decisions Made

- The `http-response-rule`, `tcp-request-rule`, `tcp-response-rule`, and `httpcheck` resources were implemented as nested resources within the `haproxy_frontend` and `haproxy_backend` resources.
- The `HttpResponseRulePayload`, `TcpRequestRulePayload`, `TcpResponseRulePayload`, and `HttpcheckPayload` structs in `internal/provider/models.go` were updated to include all parameters from the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation.
- The `haproxy_client.go` was updated to handle the CRUD operations for the `httpcheck` resource.

## Troubles Encountered

- A large number of compiler errors were encountered in `internal/provider/resource_backend.go` due to a mismatch between the `backendResourceModel` and the `BackendPayload` struct in `internal/provider/models.go`. This was resolved by updating the `backendResourceModel` to match the `BackendPayload` definition.
- A typo was introduced in the import path in `internal/provider/resource_backend.go`, which was quickly resolved.
- Duplicated functions were added to `internal/provider/haproxy_client.go`, which were subsequently removed.

## Bad Assumptions Uncovered

- It was initially assumed that the `BackendPayload` in `internal/provider/models.go` was more complex than it actually was. This led to the addition of unnecessary fields to the `backendResourceModel` in `internal/provider/resource_backend.go`, which caused the compiler errors.

## Lessons Learned

- It is important to carefully check the HAProxy Data Plane API documentation to ensure that all parameters are included in the payload structs.
- It is important to ensure that the resource models and payload structs are in sync to avoid compiler errors.
- It is important to avoid duplicating code, as this can lead to errors and make the code more difficult to maintain.

## Missing Context Identified

- No missing context was identified in this phase.

## Where We Are Now

We have successfully implemented full feature parity for the `http-response-rule`, `tcp-request-rule`, `tcp-response-rule`, and `httpcheck` resources.

## What is Left to Do

The following tasks remain:

-   Implement full feature parity for `tcp-check` in `haproxy_backend`.
-   Cleanup of the old code.
-   Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
-   Add a troubleshooting section to the documentation.
-   Run end-to-end tests.
